The file pong_extended.py can be run which is a running game that simulates an idea for an
interactive LED-court for volleyball.

This simulation is in 2D and the height aspect of volleyball is ignored. In this simulation
there is one player on each side of the field which can be moved using keyboard input
(technically they can both be moved to the other side of the field, but it is assumed that
for the purpose of the game the user will not do this and instead follow the volleyball
rules). The ball can be played by colliding with a player object. When the ball leaves the
field the game is over. The pulsing rings and the ball can be sped up and down using
keyboard input.
